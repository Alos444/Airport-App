### Purpose: 

Design and implement program for real-world problems.

Ability to apply advanced programming techniques.

Communicate design decisions for the selection, storage and manipulation of
data.

## Client Brief

We have been asked to design and develop a prototype application that demonstrates
how data form the Airport data set  can be formatted, cleaned, and used to generate
specific outputs.

## Functional requirements

● A means to load the initial data set (which consists of three CSV files) and translate it
into a suitable format, either XML, or JSON or an entity relationship structure (not
CSV)

● A means to back up the data in this format using either files or a database. This
should preserve the current state of the data when the program is closed, and make
it available when the program is reopened.

● A process for cleaning and preparing the initial data set, managing inconsistences,
errors, missing values and any specific changes required by the client.

● A graphical user interface(s) for interacting with the data that enables the user to:
  1. Load and clean an initial data set (from the CV format)
  2. Load and save a prepared data set (from its translated format)
  3. Use the prepared data set to generate output and visualisations
  4. Manipulate the range of values used to generate output and visualisations
